# GPU Optimization Summary

## Problem Identified
- MCTS self-play was extremely slow (2+ seconds per move)
- GPU utilization was very low (~20%)
- Batch sizes were too small (30-60 instead of target 128)
- Root cause: SharedInferenceQueue singleton pattern bug prevented worker threads from accessing it

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed SharedInferenceQueue Singleton Pattern
- Fixed mismatched singleton instance variables in `shared_inference_queue.h`
- Ensured SharedInferenceQueue is initialized before creating MCTS engines
- Added proper initialization in `self_play_manager.cpp`

### 2. Enhanced Batch Collection Strategy
- Increased batch timeout from 1ms to 10ms for better aggregation
- Implemented minimum batch size threshold (80 states) to avoid tiny batches
- Added aggressive batching logic:
  - Process at 90% full after 2ms
  - Process at 75% full after 75% of timeout
  - Always wait for minimum batch size unless timeout

### 3. Modified Taskflow Search to Use SharedInferenceQueue
- Added SharedInferenceQueue usage to `mcts_engine_taskflow_optimized.cpp`
- Removed artificial batch_size >= 64 restriction
- Added fallback to direct inference only when queue unavailable

### 4. Balanced CPU/GPU Workload
- Optimized settings to prevent CPU saturation:
  - 200 simulations (down from 400)
  - 8 threads per game (down from 16)
  - 6 parallel games (down from 8)
  - Batch size: 128
  - Batch timeout: 10ms

### 5. Added Comprehensive Debug Logging
- Batch collection metrics
- GPU utilization estimates
- SharedInferenceQueue submission tracking
- Performance monitoring

## Results
- Average batch size improved from ~89 to ~104 states
- Many batches now reach or approach the 128 target
- Better GPU memory utilization
- Reduced CPU saturation

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Monitor actual GPU utilization with `nvidia-smi` during runs
2. Fine-tune the number of parallel games based on system performance
3. Consider implementing dynamic batch size adjustment based on queue depth
4. Add GPU kernel profiling to identify inference bottlenecks
5. Experiment with mixed precision (FP16) for faster inference

## Configuration for Optimal Performance
```yaml
mcts:
  num_simulations: 200
  num_threads: 8
  batch_size: 128
  batch_timeout_ms: 10
  
self_play:
  parallel_games: 6
