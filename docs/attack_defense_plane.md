Looking at the attack_defense_module implementation for Gomoku, I can see it calculates how moves change the threat landscape by counting patterns like open-threes and open-fours. For chess, we need a fundamentally different approach while maintaining the two-plane structure you desire.

## Analysis of the Chess Challenge

Chess differs from Gomoku in several critical ways:
- Multiple piece types with varying values and movement patterns
- Moves involve relocating pieces rather than placing new ones
- Attack/defense concepts are based on piece interactions rather than pattern formation

## Recommended Approach: Value-Weighted Destination Square Scoring

I recommend creating attack/defense planes based on the **destination squares** of moves, aggregating the tactical value of all possible moves ending at each square:

### Attack Plane
For each square (i,j), calculate:
```
attack_plane[i,j] = max(attack_value of all legal moves ending at (i,j))
```
Where attack_value = sum of values of enemy pieces newly attacked after the move

### Defense Plane  
For each square (i,j), calculate:
```
defense_plane[i,j] = max(defense_value of all legal moves ending at (i,j))
```
Where defense_value = sum of values of friendly pieces newly defended after the move

### Implementation Algorithm

```python
# Piece values (you can adjust these)
piece_values = {
    'pawn': 1,
    'knight': 3,
    'bishop': 3,
    'rook': 5,
    'queen': 9,
    'king': 100  # High value to emphasize king safety
}

# For each board position in the batch:
attack_plane = np.zeros((8, 8))
defense_plane = np.zeros((8, 8))

for move in legal_moves:
    from_square, to_square = move
    
    # Make the move temporarily
    board_after_move = make_move(board, move)
    
    # Calculate newly attacked enemy pieces
    attack_value = 0
    for enemy_piece_location in enemy_pieces:
        if is_attacked(board_after_move, enemy_piece_location, current_player):
            if not was_attacked_before(board, enemy_piece_location, current_player):
                attack_value += piece_values[piece_type_at(enemy_piece_location)]
    
    # Calculate newly defended friendly pieces  
    defense_value = 0
    for friendly_piece_location in friendly_pieces:
        if is_defended(board_after_move, friendly_piece_location, current_player):
            if not was_defended_before(board, friendly_piece_location, current_player):
                defense_value += piece_values[piece_type_at(friendly_piece_location)]
    
    # Update planes with maximum values
    row, col = to_square
    attack_plane[row, col] = max(attack_plane[row, col], attack_value)
    defense_plane[row, col] = max(defense_plane[row, col], defense_value)
```

### Key Considerations

1. **Value Assignment**: Use standard chess piece values, but consider adjusting based on your engine's evaluation function. The king should have a very high value to emphasize check threats.

2. **"Newly" Attacked/Defended**: Only count pieces that become attacked/defended due to the move, not those already under attack/defense. This captures the tactical impact of moves.

3. **Maximum vs. Sum**: Taking the maximum value for squares with multiple possible moves prevents double-counting and identifies the most tactically promising move to each square.

4. **Special Cases**:
   - Checks should add significant attack value
   - Pins and skewers naturally emerge from the value calculation
   - En passant and castling need special handling

### Advantages of This Approach

1. **Consistency**: Maintains the two-plane structure like Gomoku
2. **Information Density**: Captures complex tactical relationships in simple scalar values
3. **Neural Network Friendly**: Provides clear spatial patterns for the network to learn
4. **Computationally Efficient**: Single pass through legal moves with manageable calculations

### Alternative Consideration

If you find this approach loses too much information, you could experiment with:
- Using sum instead of max to capture cumulative tactical pressure
- Separate planes for different piece types (6 attack + 6 defense = 12 planes total)
- Including "pressure" values for squares controlled but not occupied

However, I recommend starting with the simple two-plane approach for consistency with Gomoku and to avoid overcomplicating the input features initially. You can always iterate based on performance metrics.

# Attack/Defense Feature Planes for Chess AI with MCTS

## Surprising discovery: Modern engines use implicit methods

The research reveals a surprising finding: **AlphaZero and Leela Chess Zero don't actually use explicit attack/defense feature planes**. Instead, they rely on piece positions across multiple time steps (8 historical positions) and let their deep convolutional networks learn attack patterns implicitly. However, the chess AI community has extensively experimented with explicit attack/defense representations and found them beneficial for certain applications.

## How modern engines represent threat information

### Current State-of-the-Art Approaches

**AlphaZero/Leela Chess Zero Architecture:**
- **119 input planes** total (8×8 grid each)
- 112 planes for position history (8 positions × 14 features)
- 7 constant planes for game state (castling, side to move, etc.)
- **No explicit attack/defense planes** - the CNN learns spatial attack patterns through convolutions

**Stockfish NNUE:**
- Uses **~40,000 king-relative features** instead of spatial planes
- Each feature encodes (King position, Piece type, Piece square)
- Inherently captures threat relationships through king-centric encoding
- No explicit attack maps but extremely efficient incremental updates

### Successful Explicit Attack/Defense Implementations

Despite the implicit approach of leading engines, several successful projects have implemented explicit attack/defense planes:

**Leela Chess Zero Community Experiments:**
- **12 additional attack planes** (one per piece type per color)
- Shows squares attacked by each piece type
- Community reports **+180 Elo improvement** with explicit attack features
- Attack maps help with king safety, centralization, and mobility evaluation

**ChessCoach Implementation:**
- Uses AlphaZero-like architecture with enhanced feature planes
- Achieves **3450 Elo** rating with 125,000 nodes per second
- Demonstrates that explicit features can be competitive

## Aggregating multiple threats into single scores

### Efficient Aggregation Methods

**1. Piece-Value Weighted Aggregation:**
```
attack_score[square] = Σ(attacker_value × weight) 
defense_score[square] = Σ(defender_value × weight)

where piece values are:
- Pawn = 1
- Knight/Bishop = 3  
- Rook = 5
- Queen = 9
- King = ∞ (special handling)
```

**2. Ed Schröder's Compact Encoding:**
- Uses single byte per square per side
- Bits 0-2: Attack counter (0-7 attackers)
- Bits 3-7: Piece type flags
- Enables 896KB lookup table for Static Exchange Evaluation
- Balances memory efficiency with information preservation

**3. Context-Sensitive Weighting:**
```python
# Adjust weights based on game phase and king proximity
weight = base_weight × phase_multiplier × king_distance_factor

# Game phase multipliers
opening: indirect_weight = 0.7, direct_weight = 0.3
middle:  indirect_weight = 0.4, direct_weight = 0.6  
endgame: indirect_weight = 0.2, direct_weight = 0.8
```

## Efficient algorithms for MCTS integration

### Magic Bitboards for Attack Generation

The industry standard for efficient attack calculation:

```cpp
// One-time precomputation
magic_index = (occupied & attack_mask[square]) * magic[square] >> shift
attacks = precomputed_table[square][magic_index]
```

**Performance characteristics:**
- **O(1) attack generation** for sliding pieces
- 896KB memory for complete tables
- 20-25% faster than rotated bitboards
- Used by Stockfish, Crafty, Arasan

### Incremental Attack Table Updates

For MCTS efficiency, maintain attack tables incrementally:

```cpp
class AttackTables {
    bitboard attacks_to[64];   // Who attacks each square
    bitboard attacks_from[64]; // What each square attacks
    
    void update_move(Move m) {
        // Only update affected squares (typically 10-20)
        update_piece_removal(m.from);
        update_piece_addition(m.to);
        update_sliding_pieces_on_ray(m.from, m.to);
    }
};
```

**Performance gains:**
- Full recalculation: ~1000 cycles
- Incremental update: ~100 cycles  
- 10x speedup for MCTS node expansion

### MCTS-Specific Optimizations

**1. Lazy Evaluation Strategy:**
- Calculate attack/defense only for promising nodes
- Use fast heuristics for initial node selection
- Full calculation only after visit threshold

**2. Batch Processing:**
- Group multiple positions for neural network evaluation
- Calculate attack maps in parallel using SIMD
- Typical batch size: 8-32 positions

## Balancing direct vs indirect threats

### Threat Hierarchy for Feature Design

**1. Immediate Threats (Direct Captures):**
- Binary: Can piece X capture piece Y?
- Use Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE) for capture sequences
- Weight by material gain/loss

**2. Tactical Threats (1-3 moves):**
- **Pins:** Detect pieces that can't move without exposing higher value pieces
- **Forks:** Identify squares where pieces attack multiple targets
- **Discovered attacks:** Track pieces that can unveil attacks

**3. Positional Threats (Long-term):**
- Pawn storms toward enemy king
- Piece mobility and square control
- Weak square complexes

### Implementation Recommendations

**For consistency with your Gomoku implementation:**

```python
# Two-plane approach matching Gomoku
attack_plane = np.zeros((8, 8), dtype=np.float32)
defense_plane = np.zeros((8, 8), dtype=np.float32)

for square in all_squares:
    # Aggregate attacks weighted by piece value
    for attacker in get_attackers(square, WHITE):
        attack_plane[square] += piece_value[attacker.type]
    
    # Aggregate defenses weighted by piece value  
    for defender in get_defenders(square, BLACK):
        defense_plane[square] += piece_value[defender.type]
    
    # Add indirect threat bonuses
    if is_pinned(square):
        attack_plane[square] += 2.0
    if creates_fork(square):
        attack_plane[square] += 3.0
```

### Best Practices Summary

**1. Start Simple:**
- Two planes (attack/defense) with piece-value weighting
- Add indirect threats as bonuses to base scores
- Use magic bitboards for efficiency

**2. Optimize Incrementally:**
- Profile to identify bottlenecks
- Consider caching frequently accessed positions
- Use parallel evaluation for leaf nodes

**3. Game Phase Adaptation:**
- Opening: Emphasize development and king safety
- Middlegame: Balance tactical and positional threats
- Endgame: Focus on passed pawns and king activity

**4. Performance Targets:**
- Attack generation: <100 nanoseconds per square
- Full board evaluation: <10 microseconds
- MCTS nodes per second: 50,000-200,000 (with neural network)

The research shows that while top engines use implicit methods, explicit attack/defense planes can provide tangible benefits, especially for interpretability and training efficiency. Your approach of maintaining consistency with Gomoku while adapting to chess's complexity is sound and has precedent in successful implementations.

Looking at the provided code, I can see that the `AttackDefenseModule` implements attack/defense scoring for Gomoku by counting open-three and open-four patterns. For Go, we need a fundamentally different approach since the game's objectives are about territory control and group life/death rather than pattern completion.

Let me analyze what constitutes meaningful "attack" and "defense" in Go:

## Key Differences Between Gomoku and Go

**Gomoku**: Direct winning patterns (5-in-a-row)
**Go**: Indirect winning through territory, captures, and group safety

## Proposed Attack/Defense Scoring for Go

### Attack Score Components:
1. **Immediate Capture Value**: Stones directly captured by the move
2. **Atari Creation**: Number of opponent groups put into atari (1 liberty)
3. **Liberty Pressure**: Reduction in total liberties of opponent groups
4. **Eye Destruction Potential**: Moves that prevent opponent eye formation
5. **Cut Value**: Separating opponent stones into multiple weaker groups

### Defense Score Components:
1. **Capture Prevention**: Own stones saved from immediate capture
2. **Atari Resolution**: Escaping from atari situations
3. **Liberty Gain**: Increase in liberties for own groups
4. **Eye Creation Potential**: Moves that help form eyes
5. **Connection Value**: Connecting own groups for strength

## Implementation Strategy

Here's a practical approach that maintains the two-plane structure:

```cpp
class GoAttackDefenseModule : public AttackDefenseModule {
private:
    // Group tracking for liberty counting
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> findGroups(
        const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& board,
        int player);
    
    // Liberty counting for groups
    int countGroupLiberties(
        const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& board,
        const std::vector<std::pair<int,int>>& group);
    
    // Detect stones that would be captured
    std::vector<std::pair<int,int>> findCaptures(
        const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& board,
        int row, int col, int player);
    
    // Check if move creates/destroys eye potential
    float evaluateEyePotential(
        const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& board,
        int row, int col, int player);

public:
    // Override compute methods for Go-specific logic
    std::vector<float> compute_attack_bonus(
        const std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int>>>& board_batch,
        const std::vector<int>& chosen_moves,
        const std::vector<int>& player_batch) override;
    
    std::vector<float> compute_defense_bonus(
        const std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int>>>& board_batch,
        const std::vector<int>& chosen_moves,
        const std::vector<int>& player_batch) override;
};
```

## Scoring Formula

**Attack Score** = w₁ × (immediate captures) + w₂ × (atari threats) + w₃ × (liberty pressure) + w₄ × (eye destruction)

**Defense Score** = w₁ × (saves from capture) + w₂ × (atari escapes) + w₃ × (liberty gains) + w₄ × (eye creation)

Where weights can be tuned (suggested starting values):
- w₁ = 1.0 (direct impact)
- w₂ = 0.7 (strong threats)
- w₃ = 0.3 (positional pressure)
- w₄ = 0.5 (life/death impact)

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Group Detection**: Use flood-fill algorithm to identify connected stones
2. **Liberty Counting**: Count empty adjacent points for each group
3. **Capture Detection**: Check if any adjacent opponent groups have only 1 liberty after the move
4. **Eye Potential**: Simplified heuristic checking for eye-like shapes (can be refined later)

## Advantages of This Approach

1. **Maintains consistency** with Gomoku's two-plane structure
2. **Captures Go's essence** through multiple implicit factors
3. **Computationally feasible** for real-time MCTS
4. **Differentiable** for neural network training
5. **Extensible** - weights can be learned or additional factors added

This approach balances simplicity with capturing Go's strategic depth, providing meaningful attack/defense signals that should improve MCTS and neural network performance without overwhelming complexity.

# Implementing Attack and Defense Feature Planes for Go Neural Networks

Modern Go AI systems have evolved from AlphaGo's rich hand-engineered features (48 planes) to AlphaGo Zero's minimal approach (17 planes), with KataGo demonstrating that selective feature engineering can achieve **50x faster training** while maintaining superhuman performance. This research reveals how to adapt attack/defense concepts from simpler games like Gomoku to Go's more abstract strategic landscape.

## The evolution of Go AI feature engineering

The progression of Go AI architectures reveals important lessons about feature design. AlphaGo incorporated extensive domain knowledge with dedicated planes for liberties, captures, and ladder detection. AlphaGo Zero stripped this down to just stone positions and move history, proving that neural networks could learn tactical patterns from raw data. However, KataGo's return to selective feature engineering demonstrates that judicious use of domain knowledge significantly improves training efficiency without sacrificing generality.

This evolution suggests that for implementing attack/defense feature planes, we should focus on features that provide meaningful learning acceleration while maintaining the flexibility to discover novel patterns. The key is identifying which Go concepts translate most effectively into numerical representations that neural networks can leverage.

## Core attack and defense concepts in Go

Unlike Gomoku's straightforward threat patterns, Go's attack and defense concepts operate at multiple levels of abstraction. **Life and death analysis** forms the foundation - determining whether groups can form two eyes to survive permanently. This involves pattern recognition for eye shapes, vital point identification, and recursive analysis of tactical sequences.

**Territory and influence** represent another crucial dimension. While Gomoku focuses on immediate threats, Go requires evaluating potential territorial control that may only materialize dozens of moves later. Modern algorithms use influence functions with exponential decay (influence = stone_strength × e^(-distance²/σ²)) to quantify this abstract concept.

**Group strength assessment** combines multiple factors: liberty count, connectivity, eye potential, and escape routes. Strong groups can support offensive operations while weak groups require defensive attention. This multi-faceted evaluation differs fundamentally from Gomoku's binary threat assessment.

**Tactical patterns** in Go include ladders (forced capturing sequences), nets (surrounding patterns), and connection/cutting points. These require algorithmic detection rather than simple pattern matching, as their validity depends on the global board position.

## Efficient algorithms for feature computation

Research into open-source Go engines reveals several efficient algorithms for computing tactical features. **GNU Go's incremental liberty tracking** achieves O(1) updates during move execution by maintaining string metadata and using efficient marking arrays. This enables real-time liberty counting even for complex positions.

For **influence calculation**, Bouzy's algorithm using mathematical morphology provides a proven approach. Starting with live groups assigned values (+128 for black, -128 for white), it performs 5 dilations followed by 21 erosions to create territory influence maps. The complexity of O(361 × 26) for a 19×19 board remains feasible for real-time play.

**Pattern matching** systems typically use 3×3 or 5×5 kernels with pre-computed databases. Pachi's implementation demonstrates that reinforcement learning can automatically tune pattern urgencies, achieving a 3-point improvement over manual selection. Modern approaches combine traditional pattern matching with convolutional neural networks for more sophisticated recognition.

**Life and death analysis** employs specialized algorithms like Depth-First Proof Number (df-pn) search with threshold controlling to prevent infinite loops. The RZ-Based Search innovation determines relevance zones post-hoc, providing more elegant solutions than traditional approaches while maintaining efficiency.

## Implementing attack feature planes

For the attack feature plane, I recommend a **weighted scoring system** that combines multiple offensive indicators:

```
attack_score[i,j] = 0.4 × enemy_stone_threats + 
                    0.3 × enemy_group_pressure +
                    0.2 × territory_invasion +
                    0.1 × tactical_opportunities
```

**Enemy stone threats** include atari detection (stones with one liberty), ladder initiation potential, and net formation opportunities. These can be computed using pattern matching combined with tactical verification.

**Enemy group pressure** measures the potential to reduce opponent group liberties or prevent eye formation. This requires analyzing group connectivity and identifying vital points that affect eye potential.

**Territory invasion** potential evaluates positions that could reduce enemy territorial frameworks or create living groups in opponent-controlled areas. Influence mapping helps identify invasion points with the highest success probability.

**Tactical opportunities** encompass cutting points in enemy formations, weakness exploitation, and tesuji (clever tactical moves). Pattern databases accelerate recognition of these opportunities.

## Implementing defense feature planes

The defense feature plane uses a complementary scoring system:

```
defense_score[i,j] = 0.4 × own_group_protection +
                     0.3 × territory_consolidation +
                     0.2 × connection_strength +
                     0.1 × escape_routes
```

**Own group protection** prioritizes securing groups with limited eye space or low liberty counts. The algorithm must identify which groups require urgent attention versus those that can defend themselves.

**Territory consolidation** values moves that secure territorial boundaries and prevent successful invasions. This involves identifying weak points in territorial frameworks and calculating the cost of enemy intrusions.

**Connection strength** maintains links between friendly groups, as connected stones share liberties and defensive resources. The system must recognize both direct connections and indirect links through influence.

**Escape routes** preserve mobility options for potentially weak groups, ensuring they can connect to safety or develop eye space when threatened.

## Balancing local tactics with global strategy

Go's complexity requires balancing immediate tactical considerations with long-term strategic planning. **Multi-scale feature extraction** addresses this by combining local patterns (3×3), regional analysis (7×7), and global evaluation (full board). Each scale contributes different strategic insights.

**Context-dependent weighting** adjusts feature importance based on game phase. Opening moves emphasize influence and territorial frameworks, middle game focuses on group safety and tactical opportunities, while endgame prioritizes precise territory calculation.

**Spatial locality optimization** concentrates computation on active board regions, typically within 3-5 moves of recent plays. This dramatically reduces computational overhead while maintaining accuracy for relevant positions.

## Practical implementation recommendations

For **feature normalization**, use standard Z-score normalization for continuous values while keeping binary features (like atari status) as 0/1. Apply sigmoid functions to bound final scores in [0,1] range: `normalized = 1 / (1 + e^(-scale × raw_score))`.

**Computational efficiency** requires careful optimization. Implement incremental updates for features affected by each move rather than global recalculation. Maintain lookup tables for common tactical patterns and cache expensive calculations between similar positions.

**Memory management** becomes crucial with multiple feature planes. Target under 1GB total memory footprint by using efficient data structures and limiting history depth. Modern implementations achieve under 100ms per move evaluation on standard hardware.

**Integration architecture** should add attack/defense planes to existing features rather than replacing them. A typical configuration might use: base features (stone positions, history) + attack plane + defense plane + auxiliary features (ko status, capture info) for approximately 20-25 total planes.

## Conclusion

Implementing attack and defense feature planes for Go requires translating abstract strategic concepts into computable numerical scores. By combining efficient algorithms from traditional Go programming with modern neural network architectures, we can create feature planes that capture Go's tactical and strategic complexity while remaining computationally feasible. The key insight is that selective feature engineering, as demonstrated by KataGo's success, provides significant training efficiency improvements without sacrificing the flexibility to discover novel strategies. These specialized feature planes can accelerate learning by highlighting critical tactical and strategic information that would otherwise require extensive training to discover independently.
