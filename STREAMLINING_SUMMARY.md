## Key Components Retained
1. **Batch Tree Selection** (`mcts_engine_batch_tree_simple.cpp`)
   - Simple, efficient batch processing
   - ~2x performance improvement (1100ms → 450-500ms per move)
   - Uses SharedInferenceQueue for proper batching

2. **SharedInferenceQueue** 
   - Central batching mechanism
   - Handles GPU batch aggregation across workers

3. **Core MCTS Components**
   - Basic MCTS engine and node structures
   - Transposition table (PHMap implementation)
   - Node pool for memory efficiency
   - GPU memory pool

4. **Game-Specific Features**
   - Attack/Defense modules (used by game states)
   - Game state implementations

## Performance Results
- **Before streamlining**: ~1100ms per move
- **After batch tree selection**: ~450-500ms per move
- **Batch size**: 64 states per batch
- **GPU utilization**: Improved with proper batching

## Benefits of Streamlining
1. **Reduced complexity** - Easier to understand and maintain
2. **Faster compilation** - Fewer files to compile
3. **Cleaner architecture** - Single clear path for search execution
4. **Maintained performance** - Best performing method retained

## Search Method Flow
```
Multi-threaded: executeBatchedTreeSearch (batch_tree_simple.cpp)

Batch collection (64 simulations at once)
  ↓
SharedInferenceQueue (batch aggregation)

GPU inference
  ↓
Parallel backpropagation
```

## Future Optimizations
To achieve sub-100ms move times:
1. Increase batch size from 64 to 128
2. Implement pipelining (prefetch next batch)
3. Reduce tree traversal overhead
4. Consider lighter neural network architecture
