# AlphaZero MCTS Optimization Summary

## Problem Analysis

The original implementation suffered from severe underutilization of CPU/GPU resources due to:

1. **Shared Neural Network Bottleneck**: All MCTS engines shared a single neural network instance, creating serialization
2. **Excessive CUDA Synchronization**: 5+ synchronization calls per inference prevented GPU pipelining
3. **Global Singleton Contention**: AggressiveMemoryManager with mutex locks created thread contention
4. **Inefficient Batch Collection**: Synchronous wait patterns led to CPU idle time
5. **False Sharing**: Atomic operations on shared cache lines caused performance degradation

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Multi-Instance Neural Network Architecture
- **File**: `include/mcts/multi_instance_nn_manager.h`
- **Key Features**:
  - Each MCTS engine gets its own independent neural network instance
  - Separate CUDA streams per instance prevent inter-engine synchronization
  - Load balancing across multiple GPUs if available
  - Zero shared state between instances

### 2. Optimized ResNet Model
- **File**: `include/nn/optimized_resnet_model.h`
- **Optimizations**:
  - Removed all but one CUDA synchronization point
  - Implemented async memory transfers with pinned memory
  - Thread-local tensor buffers eliminate allocation overhead
  - Stream-based pipelining for overlapped computation
  - Pre-allocated buffers with 20% extra capacity

### 3. Thread-Local Memory Management
- **File**: `include/utils/thread_local_memory_manager.h`
- **Benefits**:
  - Replaced global singleton with thread-local instances
  - Lock-free memory tracking
  - Reduced contention in multi-threaded scenarios
  - Efficient RAII-based allocation tracking

### 4. Optimized Self-Play Manager
- **File**: `include/selfplay/optimized_self_play_manager.h`
- **Features**:
  - True parallel game generation with independent workers
  - CPU thread affinity for optimal core utilization
  - Async game collection pipeline
  - Efficient work distribution via lock-free queue

### 5. Performance Monitoring
- Built-in performance metrics for each component
- Real-time throughput monitoring
- Per-instance statistics tracking
- Memory usage reporting

## Building and Running

### Build the Optimized Version
```bash
./build_optimized.sh
```

### Run Optimized Self-Play
```bash
./bin/Release/omoknuni_cli_optimized self-play-optimized --config ../config_optimized_true_parallel.yaml
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

Based on the optimizations:

1. **GPU Utilization**: Should increase from ~30% average to 70%+ sustained
2. **CPU Utilization**: Should increase from 5-25% to 60%+ across all cores
3. **Throughput**: Expected 3-5x improvement in games/second
4. **Latency**: Reduced inference latency due to eliminated synchronization
5. **Memory**: More efficient usage with thread-local management

## Configuration Tuning

Key parameters in `config_optimized_true_parallel.yaml`:

- `self_play_num_parallel_games`: Number of independent engines (set to 8)
- `mcts_num_threads`: Threads per engine (3 Ã— 8 = 24 total)
- `mcts_batch_size`: Increased to 16 for better GPU utilization
- `mcts_batch_timeout_ms`: Reduced to 2ms for faster response

## Hardware-Specific Optimizations

For Ryzen 9 5900X + RTX 3060 Ti:
- 8 parallel engines optimally utilize 24 CPU threads
- Larger batch sizes (16) maximize GPU throughput
- Thread affinity ensures even distribution across CCX complexes
- Memory limits prevent swapping while maximizing utilization

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **Dynamic Batch Sizing**: Adjust batch size based on queue depth
2. **Multi-GPU Support**: Distribute engines across multiple GPUs
3. **CUDA Graph Optimization**: Use CUDA graphs for fixed computation patterns
4. **TensorRT Integration**: Convert models to TensorRT for faster inference
5. **Memory Pool Optimization**: Implement custom memory pools for game states
6. **Profile-Guided Optimization**: Use profiling data to identify remaining bottlenecks

## Monitoring and Debugging

The optimized implementation includes:
- Real-time performance statistics
- Per-worker metrics
- Memory usage tracking
- Throughput monitoring every 5 seconds
