# Performance Analysis Summary

## Current State
- **Move Time**: ~1450ms per move
- **GPU Inference Time**: ~21ms per batch 
- **CPU Time**: 98.5% of total time
- **GPU Utilization**: <10% actual (despite good batch sizes)

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Sequential Tree Operations (Primary Bottleneck)
The MCTS implementation processes each simulation independently:
- 200 simulations × 6 games = 1200 tree traversals per move
- Each traversal involves multiple atomic operations
- No batching of tree operations

### 2. Excessive Atomic Operations
- Virtual loss uses expensive memory_order_acq_rel
- Each node access requires 3-4 atomic loads
- Value updates use compare_exchange loops

### 3. Memory Access Inefficiency
- Nodes scattered in memory (shared_ptr indirection)
- Poor cache locality during traversal
- No prefetching or SIMD optimization

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Improved Batch Collection
- Increased batch timeout: 10ms → 20ms
- Increased minimum batch size: 80 → 120
- Better continuous batching logic

### 2. Reduced Atomic Overhead
- Changed virtual loss operations to use memory_order_relaxed
- Reduced memory fence overhead
- Optimized atomic operation ordering

### 3. Configuration Tuning
- Balanced CPU/GPU workload (200 sims, 8 threads, 6 games)
- Optimized for RTX 3060 Ti capabilities

## Remaining Issues

The fundamental problem is architectural:
- Tree traversal is inherently sequential
- CPU spends 98.5% of time on tree operations
- GPU sits idle waiting for batches

## Recommended Solutions

### Short Term (Immediate Impact)
1. **Batch Tree Selection**: Process multiple simulations together during tree traversal
2. **State Pooling**: Reuse game states instead of cloning
3. **SIMD Optimization**: Vectorize UCB calculations

### Long Term (Major Refactoring)
1. **GPU Tree Search**: Move entire MCTS to GPU
2. **Lock-Free Architecture**: Replace atomics with RCU
3. **Cache-Optimized Layout**: Contiguous node storage

## Expected Performance Gains
- Current: 1450ms/move, <10% GPU
- With short-term fixes: 400-600ms/move, 30-40% GPU
- With GPU tree search: 100-200ms/move, 80%+ GPU

## Next Steps
1. Implement batch tree selection algorithm
2. Add state pooling for game states
3. Profile with NVIDIA Nsight to identify GPU bottlenecks
4. Consider AlphaZero-style batched MCTS implementation
